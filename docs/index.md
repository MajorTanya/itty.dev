In serverless API design, bytes matter.
Simply put, the less JS you load, the faster your invocations are.

Each itty package is carefully crafted for the perfect balance of power, control, and low byte count.  You may find smaller ones out there, but likely with less power.  Conversely, you'll certainly find more feature-rich libraries, but typically at the cost of many times the size of itty libs.

When size === speed, come see us.
