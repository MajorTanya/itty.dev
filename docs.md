###  Bytes matter.

The internet is fast, sure, but every line of code (yours or included packages) truly adds up.  You feel it when writing, when waiting on your pipelines to build.  Your users feel it when they load the request/page.

Each itty library aims to simplify *your* code, while being *extremely* byte-optimized for final delivery. They simplify boilerplate or complex code to help keep your own code human-readable, ideally in fewer bytes than you'd spend writing the code yourself.
