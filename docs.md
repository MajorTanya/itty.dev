In serverless API design, bytes matter.
Simply put, the less JS you load, the faster your responses are.

Each itty package is carefully crafted for the perfect balance of power, control, and minimal byte count.

We don't try to solve *ALL* the problems - we just target the major ones... at a low cost to filesize.

When size matters, come see us. <3
